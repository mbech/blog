###**The journey so far**
I stopped using Sublime Text 3 and switched Vim about 4-5 months ago (judging by
my [config commits](https://github.com/mbech/.vim)).  

Working with Rails, Node, and other command-line-centric frameworks/tools, it's been great having an
editor that runs in the same window.  While I know inside that it's not that
different swapping terminal tabs rather than tabbing to a different editor
window, I appreciate the consistency of my workflow and the interfacs I use.

I've gotten very comfortable with the Vim basics, and do find editing text a bit
clunky when they're not available.  Installing [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) for Chrome and
[Vimperator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=search) 
for Firefox have gotten me many of those basic command for use in the browser, 
which is awesome and I'd recommend for anyone trying to commit them to memory.
Every little bit of repetition helps. 

###**Room for improvement**###
I've found it more challenging than I anticipated to add more complex shortcuts and
combinations to my repertoire.  The general advice is to pause and lookup a more
efficient approach when the opportunity presents itself organically, (which I
do), but those situations (e.g. replacing the first letter of each line) seem so
rare that the proper key combinatin to solve it never sticks.

###**Enter slow-vim!**###
I came across this post on the [vim subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/2w3tgs/slowvim/) and plan to give it a shot
over the next week (at least).  The concept is super simple: adding a slight,
100 ms delay) before executing nearly any command.  The idea is to encourage the
user to make more key-efficient movements and manipulations.  For example, using
'3w' to move several words rather than holding down 'l'. 

I'm hopeful that the slight-but-infuriating pause will force me to be more
mindful about where I'm being inefficient, and be a great motivator for learning
new commands, combinations, and generally 'thinking in vim' more effectively.

###**Closing thought**
I'll install slow-vim right after wrapping up this post, and update or make
another post on the results after giving it a solid tryout.
