section ideas:
why GoL? as intro

using JQuery, may redo without to see difference, using normalize.css

complication of cell next state rules, discuss how it's buggy, wonder if better

game logic - handling boundary behavior bug/issue

use of setInterval with pair of functions, activation flag to create looping
refresh
