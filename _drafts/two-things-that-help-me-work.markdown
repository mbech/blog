After making some changes to my work habits/environment, I wanted to do a writeup on *the two that seem to have had the greatest postive impact on my productivity* (coding and other tasks).  While there's nothing mind-blowing here, it may give you an idea for how to mix up your own work environment.

###**1. Stopped listening to Spotify while trying to do things**


I (like many others) really enjoy music and want it to fill my ears anytime they're not otherwise occupied.  To justify this practice, I'd checked out several posts/writeups about the pros/cons, which mostly boiled down to:

**[WORST]  Bothersome Noise <  Music or White noise < Silence [BEST]**

####Firing up Spotify, not without costs

Living in an apartment complex with thin walls, firing up [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) to stream some radio became automatic before starting any task.  

While it took time to notice, I actually believe this kicked off a very distracting habit:

* Lost time and focus switching back and forth between Spotify and work to vote each track up or down
* My brain started to freeze at song transitions, as my mind anticipated having to skip or approve of whatever came next
* Stopping work to check out the artist or name of an unknown song I like

**I was essentially conditioning myself to be interrupted every 3-5 minutes.**

*As I list out these issues, I realize they may be peculiar to streaming/voteable radio-type music services.  Listening to a static playlist over and over again, while mind-numbing, may remove the drain on mental energy required to play DJ-on-the-side ([though it may present other issues](http://blog.codinghorror.com/music-to-not-code-by/)).*

####Embracing white noise

While not nearly as entertaining, I find listening to [white noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise) both effectively drowns out aural distractions and does not require my attention once started.

Lately I've been using [Noisli](http://www.noisli.com/), which is simple to use with a great variety of background-noises (e.g. camp-fire, wind, coffee-shop, etc.) that can all be layered together.  I generally emulate a stormy day (wind/rain/thunder) along with a crackling fire and light coffee-shop ambiance.  

And of course best of all: **once set, I don't have to think about it again.**

###**2.  Switching to Vim**
I'd attempted to start using Vim ([the esoteric and oft revered/maligned text editor](http://www.vim.org/)) cold-turkey at least twice prior, but was generally blind-sided by having to "actually get something done", forcing me to revert to more familiar tools ([Sublime Text, also awesome](http://www.sublimetext.com/)).  But the combination of Vim's classic/old-school feel along with the promise of awesome efficiency (upon achieving some level of mastery) was always enough to draw me back in.

Luckily, a stint of voluntary unemployment has rescued me from the trap of 'productivity' for long enough to finally fall into the Vim.  Hurray!

I won't go into a ton of detail about the configurations I'm slowly building up ([though I keep an up-to-date backup on GitHub](https://github.com/mbech/.vim)), saving 'deeper' insights (if they ever occur) for a future post.  Instead here's two non-exhaustive lists:

#####Things I like about using Vim
* Text editing clearly has the potential to be super fast and efficient (and after about a month of daily usage, really starting to see some of that)
* Getting 'better' at Vim feels rewarding.  This is similar to learning key binds in any application, but with Vim you're essentially required (i.e. forced) to learn and use them (no cursor/menus to fall back on in the terminal).  This is also part of what makes cryptic and not-friendly to beginners.
* I get to work in the terminal (I use [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) for my terminal, along with [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)), which has had the side-effect of growing my shell knowledge/usage
* Silly but true, it helps me to get in a 'serious' coding mindset much better than using Sublime Text does.  Probably some combination of the added challenge/opportunity to improve my efficiency along with the old-school cool factor.


And for others considering the switch:
#####Things that helped my transition to using Vim (from Sublime Text)
* Setting a color scheme I like ([molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai), close to what I had in Sublime)
* Start with a blank .vimrc (customization file) and add in configurations manually (so I know what's going on and have a general knowledge of the features/settings available to me).  This one is bigger than I previously thought - it really helps to chip away at all the unknown features by adding them in one at a time.
* Attempting to revel in the learning curve and stave off frustration by keeping it fun.  Having no deadlines really helps with this last one :)

###**Runner-up: Using a standing desk**
I've included this for completeness, but the jury is still out.  

I certainly enjoy the flexibility of being able to alternate standing and sitting for periods of time, but often (as in right now) I just find myself perched on the barstool with horrible posture.
