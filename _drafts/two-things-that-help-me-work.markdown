After making some changes to my work habits/environment, I wanted to do a writeup on *the two that seem to have had the greatest postive impact on my productivity* (coding and other tasks).  While there's nothing mind-blowing here, it may give you an idea for how to mix up your own work environment.

###**1. Stopped listening to Spotify while trying to do things**


I (like many others) really enjoy music and want it to fill my ears anytime they're not otherwise occupied.  To justify this practice, I'd checked out several posts/writeups about the pros/cons, which mostly boiled down to:

**[WORST]  Bothersome Noise <  Music or White noise < Silence [BEST]**

####Firing up Spotify, not without costs

Living in an apartment complex with thin walls, firing up [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) to stream some radio became automatic before starting any task.  

While it took time to notice, I actually believe this kicked off a very distracting habit:

* Lost time and focus switching back and forth between Spotify and work to vote each track up or down
* My brain started to freeze at song transitions, as my mind anticipated having to skip or approve of whatever came next
* Stopping work to check out the artist or name of an unknown song I like

**I was essentially conditioning myself to be interrupted every 3-5 minutes.**

*As I list out these issues, I realize they may be peculiar to streaming/voteable radio-type music services.  Listening to a static playlist over and over again, while mind-numbing, may remove the drain on mental energy required to play DJ-on-the-side ([though it may present other issues](http://blog.codinghorror.com/music-to-not-code-by/)).*

####Embracing white noise

While not nearly as entertaining, I find listening to [white noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise) both effectively drowns out aural distractions and does not require my attention once started.

Lately I've been using [Noisli](http://www.noisli.com/), which is simple to use with a great variety of background-noises (e.g. camp-fire, wind, coffee-shop, etc.) that can all be layered together.  I generally emulate a stormy day (wind/rain/thunder) along with a crackling fire and light coffee-shop ambiance.  

And of course best of all: **once set, I don't have to think about it again.**

###**2. Committing to Vim**
I'd attempted to start using Vim ([the esoteric and oft revered/maligned text editor](http://www.vim.org/)) cold-turkey at least twice prior, but was generally blind-sided by having to "actually get something done", forcing me to revert to more familiar tools ([Sublime Text, also awesome](http://www.sublimetext.com/)).  But the combination of Vim's classic/old-school feel along with the promise of awesome efficiency (upon achieving some level of mastery) was always enough to draw me back in.

Luckily, a stint of voluntary unemployment has rescued me from the trap of 'productivity' for long enough to finally fall into the Vim.  Hurray!

I won't go into a ton of detail about the configurations I'm slowly building up ([though I keep an up-to-date backup on GitHub](https://github.com/mbech/.vim)), saving deeper insights for a later post (or when they occur, whichever comes first).  Instead here's two lists:

#####Things I like about using Vim

#####Things that helped me transition to using Vim (from Sublime Text)
